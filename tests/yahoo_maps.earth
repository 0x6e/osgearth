osgEarth Sample

This example pulls road map tiles from the Yahoo! Maps service.

This is for educational purposes only - it is your responsibility to abide by
the provider's terms of service when using their data.

Note the use of the <min_tile_range_factor> property - this controls how far away 
you must be before the next-resolution tile will load. The lower the numer, the
closer you must be.
