osgEarth Sample

This example tests osgEarth's image reprojection capabilities.  The imagery coming from ESRI is in WGS1984 Geodetic
and it is being reprojected on the fly to UTM epsg:26917.  Also notice that the 
reproject_before_caching attribute is set to true on the imagery sources.  This tells
osgEarth to reproject the imagery before it is written to the cache, which means that
after the initial speed hit of compositing and reprojecting the data, you will have a very
fast cache to work off.  The "tile_size" attribute is used to tell osgEarth what size
the reprojected imagery should be.
