         * Clamped geometry alters the geometry so that verticies coincide with
         * the terrain. This can result in z-fighting artifacts. Depth offsetting
         * mitigates this by biasing the depth value of the geometry. The idea is
         * similar to polygon offsetting, but is dynamic and applies to all geometry
         * (not just polygons).
         *
         * Depth offsetting works by pretending the vertex is closer to the camera 
         * than it actually is, and writing a depth value based on that simulated
         * location. The distance we shift the vertex towards the camera is the "bias".
         *
         * The "range" is the distance from camera to vertex at which a given
         * bias is applied. The minimum bias is applied to geometry at or below the
         * minimum range; the maximum bias is applied to geometry at or above the 
         * maximum range; and the bias is interpolated for ranges in between.
