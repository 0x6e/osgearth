Community
=========

Since osgEarth_ is a free open source SDK, the source code is available to
anyone and we welcome and encourage community participation when it comes
to testing, adding features, and fixing bugs.

Message Board
-------------

The best way to interact with the osgEarth team and the user community is
through the `message board`_. Here are a couple guidelines for using the
board:

* Please sign up for an account and use your real name. You can participate
  anonymously, but using your real name helps build a stronger community.
* Limit yourself to *one topic* per post. Asking multiple questions in one
  post makes it too hard to keep track of responses.
* Be patient!

OSG Forum
---------

Since osgEarth_ is built on top of OpenSceneGraph_, many questions we get
on the message boards are *really* OSG questions. We will still try our
best to help. But it's worth your while to join the `OSG Mailing List`_ or
read the `OSG Forum`_ regularly as well.

Professional Services
---------------------

The osgEarth team supports its efforts through professional services. At
`Pelican Mapping`_ we do custom software development and integration work
involving osgEarth_ (and geospatial technologies in general). `Contact us`_
if you need help!
